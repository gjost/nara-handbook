The Information Highway is still just a back-street in Japan.  You can get a university accountâ€”if you know a student or professor with connections.  It is possible, however, to hook up with one of several commercial networks, which will give you at least the basic email services.  There are a number of computer magazines on sale at the English bookstores, including Computing Japan, and there are many Japanese-language Internet magazines as well.  Kansai Time Out has a computer column which occasionally has internet information.  Check their MEETINGS section for information on local computer users groups.
