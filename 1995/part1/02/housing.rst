Housing

Welcome to the world of Nara Housing, home of the smallest apartments on Earth [asssuming you haven’t been to Tokyo yet].  Before reading any further please remember that, especially regarding housing, arrangements for JETs differ not only from prefecture to prefecture but also from school to school, etc.  Some of you will have an apartment waiting for you; others will start hunting upon arrival.

The following is a basic checklist of things to consider:


The Housing Contract
====================

DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING UNTIL YOU ARE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR LIVING SITUATION!  You have a lot to consider--commuting time, space, general convenience, how to deal diplomatically with your office, etc.  Don't feel pressured to rush into decisions with which you are not comfortable.  Call other JETs and find out what your options are.  Be certain that your apartment is livable for you -- remember it will be your private haven (or hell) for one whole year.  At first, a 1DK with all of the modern conveniences might seem appealing, however, after a few months it may feel like a prison.  Take your time making sure everything works and that you are comfortable with the arrangements, taking into consideration appliances, space, distance from train stations and other forms of civilization.  It is much easier to make a change now than several months down the road.  Remember the old saying about housing:  "'Tis better to be rude than screwed."


Rent and key money
==================

Before getting settled into your apartment, discuss with your landlord the terms of payment for rent, which averages around ¥50,000 in Nara-ken.  Also, discuss key money with your supervisor or school - often it can be paid in monthly installments along with your rent instead of being taken in one gulp.  As usual, the circumstances will be a little different for each JET, so take the time to be sure of your payment methods.


Utilities
=========

Gas, Water and Electricity:  If these utilities are not already on, have your supervisor help you register for service.  Discuss payment (how and when) with your landlord.  In many cases, an automatic payment system can be arranged through your bank.


Telephone
=========

Most likely, your predecessor sold you his or her line, but if not, you can rent or buy a line and phone.  Domestic (NTT) and international (KDD, ITT, ITJ) services are independent companies with separate billing.  When making an overseas call you can choose the company which provides the best rate for that particular time.  See "Telephone" in the JET Memo or the Communication/Telephones section of this publication for more details.  Again, automatic payment can be arranged and most international bills can be paid at Lawson Station.


Garbage
=======

In some areas of Nara Prefecture, great efforts are made to separate burnables (moeru gomi) consisting of paper, wood, etc) from non-burnables (moenai gomi), consisting of plastics, glass, cans and batteries).  In addition, once a month large items like appliances and furniture can be disposed of in the sodai gomi, or big garbage day.  (Note: although possibly illegal, this is a good time to snag extras for your apartment.  Be discreet!  This has in fact become a regular pastime for some AETs).  Ask your landlord for dates and locations.


Pest Control
============
Although mosquitoes are the most common problem, you may encounter cockroaches, spiders and even mice.  The easiest solution is spray, but “katori matto” or electric mosquito-repellent devices are available as well as roach motels, etc.  Keeping your futon aired-out is a big help as well.  For mice, cover any open drainage holes and contact the landlord.  The ever-popular home-made boric-acid cockroach ball has been given rave reviews


Furniture & Appliances
======================

Many of you will have purchased a load of things to make your apartment both comfortable and functional.  While it may be easy to identify a sink or lamp, some items are a little more tricky:

Futon  -  The traditional Japanese sleeping arrangement consists mainly of a folding mattress, an under-futon and any other combination of sheets and blankets that are appropriate for the temperature.  The futon is laid out nightly on tatami mats and stored by day in large closets called oshiire [not to be confused with oshire, “butt” or “bum”].  It is best to store the futon on a high shelf and it is imperative to air it out about once a week, exposing it to direct sunlight to kill germs.  Beat it with a futon tataki to get rid of dust.


Televisions, VCRs and Stereos
=============================

Expensive but invaluable.  If you don't have these items, hint around at school for a loaner or check out the gomi piles.  Otherwise, invest in a set with bilingual capacity.  On standard TV. there are about 2-3 bilingual movies per week and bilingual news-casts twice at night.  If a bilingual set is out of the question, try to find a small radio which can pick up bilingual FM frequencies.  Cable and satellite broadcasts are available but hideously expensive - a VCR is a better investment.  Check music stores for both movie and CD rentals.  To sign up, take your alien registration card and sign the forms they give you.  Some stores have a nominal membership fee.  Also, you may hear about “BS”...

Freebies!  Every Friday Japanese language newspapers carry a "Nara Living" section which offers free appliances and houseware products.  Just ask the English teachers at your school to translate.

There are also rumors that in Mino City, north of Osaka, there is a "dumping" place where free appliances, bicycles, etc. can be found.  Perhaps something like this exists in Nara Prefecture.  Do your homework, guys.


Climate  Control
================

As Nara is an area of extreme temperatures, it is advisable to have adequate cooling and heating units.  Upon arrival you will encounter hot, muggy weather.  If you are extremely lucky you'll have an air conditioner, but most will find an electric fan.  If you don't have a fan, get one.  Now.  You will be outraged at the price, but it's worth it.  As for the winter, you will be cold and most apartments will not have central heat or insulation.  Electric or kerosene heaters are a must.  Kerosene heaters are by far the warmest and are highly recommended by those of us who have them.  While electric space heaters and especially the built-in air con./heaters will run up your electricity bill, kerosene will only cost about ¥1000 a week and can be obtained at any gas station (make sure you tell them you want stuff that goes into a kerosene heater).  Sake shops often sell it and they usually deliver.  If you live in one of those “concrete box” apartments, be sure to keep a window open to let in fresh air while the heater is on as the heater will rob the air of oxygen.  If you live in an old drafty place, don’t worry too much.

A kotatsu is a low table with a detachable top and heater underneath.  A quilt is placed under the top and over your legs so the heat is kept in.  Call an AET friend if you buy one and are confused about how it works.  In addition, there are toilet seat and slipper warmers, electric blankets that go under you, heated carpets and all sorts of toys.

It is very important to buy kansozai (dehumidifying packets) for your closets and drawers.  Due to the humidity in Japan, mildew may grow on your clothes, camera, shoes, etc. if you don't use them.  Dehumidifiers come in plastic packages for your drawers or 350 gram plastic containers for the bottoms of your closets.


Household supplies
==================

detergents, cleaner  cleanser


In the kitchen
==============

A rice cooker is a time saver and allows you to actually cook a complete meal if you have only one or two burners.  Electric hot plates can also solve a burner shortage, and if you are really into coffee and tea, electric water heaters are handy.  Both items are a little expensive, but look for sales when you arrive.  As the Japanese aren’t big into baking, a toaster over might be the best you can do.


Laundry
=======

You may be lucky enough to have a washing machine in your apartment.  Primitive at best, these "machines" do manage to clean clothes, but without fabric softener you will be wearing cardboard T-shirts with 40-inch collars.  Older models have separate compartments for washing and spinning, and chances are you will be hanging it all out to dry.  Have your landlord give you a thorough explanation and see A Guide to Food Buying in Japan or the following list for household goods identification.  Laundromats in Japan are called "Coin Laundry" and provide both washing machines and dryers.  Detergent is sold on the spot, but it's usually a rip-off so bring your own.  Come with plenty of ¥1OO coins!


Haircuts
========

Need to get that shag out of your eyes?  [yes, this was written by a North American ALT..]  At Watashi no heya in Yamato Takada city, you can get your hair cut for about ¥2500.  At this establishment, you’ll receive a remarkably thorough shampoo and conditioning and with some luck, a massage, all included in the price.  Ask for Hideyasu.  He speaks some English.  Watashi no heya is above the Panasonic video store and is less than 5min from Yamato Takada Kintetsu station across the street from the east end of the Daiei Shopping Center

Haircuts are available at the Barber Shop in the basement of Nara Kencho for ¥1900.  Ask the Kencho JETs for more info. Another recommended hairdresser is Barbara in Nara city.  She works out of her home.  Give her a call at 0742-27-5699.
