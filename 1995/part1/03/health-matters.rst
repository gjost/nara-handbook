Insurance
=========

Nobody likes to talk about getting sick, but when the time comes and you do get sick, make sure you don’t wait to get treatment.  After all, you’re paying a big chunk of your salary every month for health insurance.

Your health insurance card: DON’T leave home without it!   It’s really difficult to get treatment without having this with you when you go to the doctor (ESPECIALLY outside of the prefecture!), so carry it with you!!  When you use your card you pay only 10% of the actual bill.  Remember to give the card to the receptionist when you register to avoid confusion.

Insurance does not cover the following procedures: induced abortion (except for medical reasons), immunization, cosmetic surgery, orthodontics, voluntary health check-ups, pregnancy, and childbirth expenses.  Also, some clinics catering to the foreign community do not accept Japanese health insurance: check ahead of time.  If you are injured by another party (e.g., if someone hits you with a car), that person’s insurance will cover all medical expenses.

Medical Questionnaire
=====================

If you have to go to the hospital, and can’t make it to an English-speaking doctor, please refer to the four-page questionnaire in the appendix.  You might consider making copies and keeping them at school and at home as well.
If you have a medical condition or take medication, take a minute and a dictionary and write the information down on the forms NOW so that in an emergency there'll be no problems.

NOTE:  volunteer English Goodwill Guides (EGG) and Student Goodwill Guides (SGG) can also help translate at medical offices.  Contact the Nara Travel Info Center (TIC) for information (see Nara City section).
