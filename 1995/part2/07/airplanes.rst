Airplanes - Domestic
####################


In a country a small as Japan it is somewhat surprising how many airports there are. There are very few flights that last more than 2 hours. Even more surprising is that flying can sometimes be cheaper than trains (especially the Shinkansen). 

For Nara folks, domestic flights mean either Itami airport (this used to be the international airport for the Kansai area), Kansai International Airport or on occasion, Nagoya. The other thing about flying versus trains is that it is usually faster (unless you fly into Narita in order to get to Tokyo -- use Haneda for traveling domestically to Tokyo).  See International Travel section for information on how to get to these airports.
