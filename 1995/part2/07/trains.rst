How to ride the train
=====================

Figuring out the fare
---------------------
To buy a ticket from the automatic vending machine, first figure out the fare from the map that’s usually above the machines.  Unless you read kanji, this can often be the hardest part of taking the train.  Another popular option is to buy the cheapest fare and pay the difference when you get there.

Timetables & platform schedules
-------------------------------
There are always station timetables outside the ticket gate and on each platform.  They are read the same way as the schedules you can pick up at the office.

The ticket machine
------------------
Insert coins or ¥1000 bills (if the machine has a bill slot).  When you have reached the amount equal to or above the necessary fare, push the appropriate button.  Your ticket and change will be dispensed.

Automatic Wicket
----------------
Put your ticket in the slot and walk on through.  Don’t forget to take your ticket from the slot at the other end!  If this sounds complicated, just watch everybody else.

The Exit Wicket
---------------
To exit, put your ticket in the slot.  If the fare is correct, the machine will accept the ticket and sometimes flash an electronic arigato and the gate will open.  If the gate closes and you hear bells and whistles when you put in your ticket, DON’T PANIC.  Just go straight to the...

Fare adjustment window or machine
---------------------------------
This is where you pay the difference between how much you in fact paid and how much you should have paid.  Either show your ticket to the guy at the window or put it into the thing that looks like a ticket vending machine.
