Money-saving for Long-Distance Train Travel
###########################################


There are a number of different money-saving ticket options available at the travel counters in JR stations, and through travel agencies.  You will see mention of a timetable—this is the big JR train schedule which looks like a telephone book.  If you can't read it, your school may have a copy and your teachers may be helpful sources of info.


Seishun Juuhachi (18) Kippu
===========================

For domestic travel, one of the cheapest ways to get around, if you don’t mind spending serious time on the train, is the Seishun Juu-hachi (18) Kippu.  You pay ¥11,300 and get a book of 5 tickets.  Each ticket is good for one day’s unlimited travel on JR.  You can ride JR buses and ferries, but not Shinkansen or Limited Express trains.  If you’re doing a day trip, you can share the tickets with friends.  They’re seasonal, and have deadlines, so check those out before you buy.  Get them at the travel counter at major stations.  Lots of Japanese people don’t know about these, and think they’re only for kids.  This is not true—anyone can use these tickets.

To get the maximum distance and speed from these tickets, ask the guy at the ticket window for the fastest way to get to wherever you’re going.  Do this at a smaller station, and not during rush hour, so that the ticket man can take his time to help you.

** Last year occasionally there were surveys which came with the ticket books—if you wrote down your itinerary, you got a free ¥1000 Orange Card in the mail.  Not a bad deal for a few minutes of your time.


"Q" Tickets, "S" Tickets
========================

These tickets can be purchased for a discount.  "Q" tickets are for long-distance travel over 201km round trip, "S" tickets are for short distances—under 201km round trip.  The discount rate is up to 30% and applies to unassigned seats of limited express and express train tickets.  These seats can only be used as shown on the time table.  Disembarking is not permitted until the specified stop.  Note the time period on the ticket—there is an expiration date.


Round Trip Reserved Seating Discount Tickets
============================================

This discount applies to long distance trip tickets for reserved seats.  The discount is about 15%, but the additional reserve seat fee for Limited Express , Bullet Train, and Limited Express Sleeper Car is not necessary.  Other limitations are the same as for "Q" and "S" tickets.


Shuyu-ken (Regional Discount Pass)
==================================
Can be used freely within a specified area for JR trains and buses.


Ippan Shuyu-ken (Ippan Route)
=============================

Over 200km must be traveled using the JR train and highway bus.  Two designated areas must be covered to use this ticket (special regions have only one designated area).  The discount rates are as follows: JR trains and boats are 20%, other modes of transport are 10% (limited express, express, green car, reserved seating are not eligible).  The discount rates and special areas are shown on the timetables by light green or light red, respectively.  The pass is good for one month.


Wide Shuyu ken
==============

This can be used at 12 locations nationwide as shown on the timetables.  The discount rate is the same as for the Ippan Shuyu-ken.  Additional fees for unassigned seats on Limited Express and Express trains are not needed.  There's also a "New Wide Shuyu-ken" which includes airplanes and boats for travel to Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu.


Mini Shuyu ken
==============

This can be used at 32 locations nationwide (look in the timetable), and the areas covered are smaller than the Wide Shuyu ken.  The discount rate is the same as for the Ippan Shuyu ken, and additional fees are not required for express seats.
