International Travel
####################


Traveling abroad from Japan is appallingly expensive.  Yet, we JETs do get sufficient salary and time-off to compensate for this flaw in the system, and Kansai International Airport (referred to hereafter as KIX) is within easy reach.  Generally, when you’re planning to travel abroad, be sure to plan far ahead.  On the other hand, yeah, the infamous waiting lists for Golden Week flights are a reality, but if you book far in advance, you’ll probably find something that suits you.  Also, be sure to inform your school, get any inoculations and your re-entry visa well in advance.  Remember, too, that if you plan to take more than three days of nenkyu, you must inform your office well one month in advance, according to your contract.  


Planning Your Trip And Buying Tickets
=====================================

Where To Go
-----------
This book does not presume to answer this question.  Probably the best advice is to consider which countries you would like to visit—and not to drag yourself somewhere just because a group of JETs is going.  Ask around and find people who've been to where you want to go (consider the sources, naturally, since we all have different tastes), and then do your homework and learn about the places you want to go.

Info
----

**Guide books** - Which one is best?  Who knows?  Lonely Planet has a good series of guide for the traveler who actually want to get out of the tourist bubble and look around.  Books are to be had at the major bookstores, and through FBC as well.

**JET and Beyond** - A good source of information, produced by AJET.  If you don’t want to wait for the new one to come out, or if you’re not an AJET member, you may be able to persuade one your senior colleagues to lend you their copy.  

**Embassies/Consulates** - Before traveling abroad you may want to contact the country's embassy or consulate and ask them for information.  They can often send you a plethora of free travel brochures and pamphlets.  Check the list of consulates below. 

**American Express** has copies of Far East Flight Plan, a publication featuring all international departures from major cities of the Far East.  American Express offices can be found in Osaka, near Umeda, and Kyoto, near Sanjo-dori and Kawaramachi.

Visas
-----
Contact the relevant consulate or embassy for information on how to get a visa.  If you're stopping at several points on your journey, some visas can be easier to get and are cheaper elsewhere (i.e. some other country): travel guide books like the Lonely Planet series are good places to look for this sort of information (but do your homework before you leave!).

Re-entry Permits
----------------
If you leave Japan during your contract to travel and wish to return, you must obtain a re-entry permit (sai-nyukoku kyo kasho) before you leave Japan.  A Single Re-entry Permit costs ¥3,000, and a Multiple Re-entry Permit cost ¥6,000.  As the names imply, a single permit allows you to come back to Japan one time only upon your return from other countries (i.e. the next time you travel, you'll need to get another permit).  With a multiple permit, however, you may re-enter Japan as many times as you wish for a one-year period or until your current visa expires.  For many JETs, buying the Multiple is highly advised, especially as any of us could meet with unexpected emergencies and have to return to our home country; having the permit in advance would reduce hassles and stress. 

You can take care of the procedures at the Nara Immigration office (see On The Job section for map & info)

Necessary documents:
--------------------

- passport
- alien registration card
- revenue stamp ¥3000 (single) or ¥6000 (multiple)
- applications are available at the Immigration office

How to buy a plane ticket
-------------------------
- Make plans with the agent over the phone.
- Put down a ¥10,000 to ¥20,000 deposit for the reservation.  This can be paid through bank transfer (then agency will provide you with the necessary info).
-  Pay the balance through a bank transfer about one month before departure date (this depends on the agency).
-  Receive the ticket at the airport on the day of departure or by mail shortly before.

Be warned:  Prices can double during and around busy seasons—New Year, Golden Week, July/August.  Ask your travel agent for the dates when the prices change, and you will usually be able to arrange to leave while the prices are still reasonable.  In the past, the prices for Christmas/New Year changed on Dec 21st, and summer prices changed around July 25th.

Osaka Travel Agents
-------------------
Here are a few phone numbers to get you started, but understand that we are not endorsing these agencies over any other.  Although these agencies have been used and liked by some JETs, others may have had problems with the same companies—ask around!  You can also check Kansai Time Out  and the English newspapers for other discount travel agencies.  

- Amnet Travel World   (freefone)	0120-16-4890, 06-647-4890
- Time Travel (does boats too)	06-271-7121
- H.I.S.				06-359-1501
- Travel Kingdom			06-309-2199

Discount Tickets
----------------

**Travel Cuts** - You can book your ticket through Travel Cuts in Canada, and have them send it to you in Japan.  The advantage of this is that you can save some money.  Travel Cuts, Vancouver.  Tel. (604) 683-6033.  (Note:  Lonely Planet Guides warn travelers not to purchase so called “back to front” tickets, as airlines do not have to honor flight tickets purchase outside the country of your trip’s origin.  Be forwarned.)  
**Avia Discount Travel** - is a non-profit organization that provides low cost international fares to the educational community.  They are one of the few American companies that reach out to the teaching community and other foreigners living in Japan.  They offer package tours to many Asian countries, Eurail passes, and itineraries for traveling in Australia and New Zealand.  What makes Avia very appealing is their “two trips in one” tickets.  These tickets are good for one year from date of issuance, so you can take your Asian vacation many months before flying home, and the Asian vacation is virtually free.  For further info,  Contact Avia Travel: 5425 Geary Blvd., San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.  Tel: (416) 668-0964.  Fax:  (415) 386-8519.

Getting to the airport
======================

There are many ways to get to the airport, and most of them involve trains, buses, or combinations thereof.  The total times listed are ideal, perfect-world times—give yourself some extra time, just in case.  NOTE: If your return flight is scheduled to arrive at KIX in the evening, you should check the last-departure times for the various buses and trains, as well as any transfers you have to make on your way home—you don't want to get stuck!

Trains
------
You have a great number of choices here, from the expensive and vaguely whale-like JR Haruka to the Retro-Future Batman train called Rapi:t, to regular express trains like the JR Airport Express.

Buses
-----
There are limousine buses from various point around Kansai to the airport, including one from in front of Kintetsu Nara station.  Call Kansai Airport Info for details: 0724-55-2500.

Car
---
If you're giving someone a ride to the airport, be prepared to shell out some cash: parking at the airport is ¥600/hour and there's a bridge toll of ¥1700.  Consider parking your car at Rinku Town on the mainland across from the airport.  You can take a free bus across to the airport (one parking pass includes 5 bus passenger tickets), and all this for ¥2000 for 3 hours.

Access to KIX from Nara
-----------------------


At The Airport
==============

International Departures are on the 4th floor

- Check your bags, pick up your boarding pass
- Buy your airport tax ticket (¥2600) from a machine
- If you have time, sample some of KIX' many interesting attractions :-)
- Show up at the Security Check point and present your airport tax ticket.
- Fill out the ubiquitous forms at Immigration (down the stairs on 3F)
- Take a Wing Shuttle to your departure gate.
	
You can meet arriving people at the International Arrivals section (first floor, north or south exits) or Domestic Arrivals on the second floor.  You can also meet people in front of the huge manekineko (Lucky Cat) statues at the far end of the north exit.

Shipping Luggage to and from the airport
========================================

When you return from abroad, you can have your luggage shipped to your door by express parcel service.  Once you've gotten through customs, go out into the canyon-like lobby (the 4-storey open space), and you will see several counters to your right.  The service costs about ¥2000-¥2500.  It takes a day or two, so you may want to give them an address at which the luggage can be delivered even if you're out (i.e., a neighbor or your office if it's close).  

You can arrange to have your luggage shipped to the airport, saving you the big hassle of having it lug it up and down train station stairs.

Itami Departures
================

You’ve decided where you’re going, you got your visa, you got your ticket, you got your shots.  You’re on your way and arrive at the airport to discover that your flight is leaving from the other airport!  Before flying out of Osaka, make sure you go to the correct airport.  There are two airports in Osaka: Itami Airport and the brand new Kansai International Airport.

Airport Bus service runs frequently between Itami Airport and the major Osaka Kintetsu and JR stations.  For many JETs, using Uehommachi station is very convenient:  The bus stops directly in front of the station (fare:  ¥510).  The distance from Namba station to its Airport Bus stop is extreeeeeeeeeeeemely far, and it’s a bit tough to find.  Avoid it if you have much baggage.
