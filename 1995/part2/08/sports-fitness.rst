Sports clubs
============

A good way to work off steam in Japan is to use your local sports center/gym.  These facilities, maintained by each municipality, vary widely, but most places have tracks, gyms (and equipment), and a wide variety of clubs and classes.  Many also have tennis courts, pools, and training gyms.  Prices are usually quite reasonable: around 200 yen per visit to a training gym, and around 400 yen for pool use.  Similar sports facilities are also run by worker's organizations and by Japanese social insurance.  

Your second best bet is to work out on the job via school clubs.  You'll improve relations with other teachers, the kids'll flip, and you'll get your daily sweat.  (During summer vacation, why not join the swimming club?)

Finally, there are plenty of sports and fitness clubs--for fees that begin at 10,000 yen for membership and about the same every month.   Prices and schemes vary; check with clubs for more details.
		
If you're interested in traditional martial arts (karate, aikido, etc.), there may be a club or private training center (dojo) in your area.  One of the best ways to find out is to ask a sports teacher at school, or inquire at the town sports center.

Swimming Pools
==============

Many towns and most schools have pools which are open in the summer (Nara, Ikoma, Takada, Ikaruga, Gojo, Kashihara, and Sango [love them water slides!] come to mind).  Most pools are open from mid-July through August 31 and charge a minimal fee (around 400 yen).  Amusement parks are also good places to cool off in a heat wave.  For year-round swimming, check out private gyms and swimming schools.

Kenkozukuri Senta in Tawaramoto costs 800 yen and is open everyday.  It's about a 15-minute walk from the Kintetsu station.  Call NIFS for more info.  

Family Koen Mae is a local stop on the Kintetsu line just south of Hirahata.  The outdoor pools are open in summer; sports fields and tennis courts too.  Again, call NIFS for info.


Hiking and biking
=================

Hikers and bikers will find that there are numerous trails both in the Yamato plain and in the mountains.  Good hiking maps are available free from Kintetsu Railways.  Ask your local station.  The Teku-Teku Maps (also available from Kintetsu--teku-teku is the sound made when walking) are very detailed and include all kinds of odd information.  Ask a Japanese friend to give you the low-down.

Finding good biking trails and jogging routes is a matter of trial and error.  The paths along rivers are often quiet, with small parks and occasional gateball/tennis courts by the riverside.  Trails leading to mountain temples or ruins are often quite scenic.  Ask AET friends.

There are quite a few marathons, eki-den (relay races, usually run at New Year's), etc. in Nara.  The Asuka marathon (Asuka--very hilly) and the Daibutsu marathon (Nara City) are two of the better known races, but most towns hold  winter events--ask around.

Amusement Parks, Ice Skating Rinks, and skiing
==============================================

Nara Dreamland: take a Dreamland-bound bus from Kintetsu/JR Nara.  Open from 10:00-17:30, closed Tuesdays.  1600 yen adults.  Has a great swimming center for summer.

Ayameike: right next to Kintetsu Ayameike.  Open 9:30-17:00, closed Wednesdays.  ¥1300 adults.  Has ice skating in winter; some carnival-type rides, nothing really hair-raising; occasional live shows featuring favorite animation characters.  Swimming center has waterslides.

Ikoma Sanjo Skyland: from Kintetsu Ikoma, take a cable car to the top of the mountain.  Open weekdays 10-17:00, Sat-Sun-holidays 10-21:00 (from July 21-Aug 31, open 10-22:00), closed Wednesdays (but not during summer hours).  1000 yen adults.  Amazing view, good roller coasters.  Ice skating in winter.

Ikoinomura  Yu-yu Land: from JR/Kintetsu Tenri by Hari-bound bus to Ipponmatsu.  9:30-17:00, closed Mondays.  For use of pool from July 21-Aug 31, adults ¥500.

Sports Center Lion: on route 24, by Kokudo ?Kyokugawa bus stop.  Indoor ice skating year round, tennis, aerobics.

Nara's skiing isn't the same as, say, Nagano, but if you want to brave the slope with lots of elementary school kids there's Kamikitayama-mura (07468-3-0027) and Dorogawa, Tenkawa-mura; both slopes open when (if?) the snowfall is heavy enough.  Again, call NIFS (0742-27-1822) for more info.


Hot Springs(Onsen), Public Baths (Sento), and Health Lands (Kenko-rando)
========================================================================

Getting naked outdoors with friends and colleagues may seem like a weird idea at first, but once those inhibitions are shed you may find it habit-forming!

Onsen
-----
Japan is a volcanic country, and you too can enjoy the benefits of all this seismic energy at an onsen—hot spring.  Onsen  can be found in Southern Nara, and offer resort fun for all kinds of budgets.   They’re a great way to get warm in winter.  Nothing like gazing at a magical garden getting woozy on the mineral vapors at these places.  Each one has it own special charm or feature of its own.  Ask around at your schools to get the latest.

Totsukawa Onsen — In Totsukawa village.  Take a bus from Kintetsu Takada-shi station, heading for Shingu or Yunomine Kamiyu Onsen and get off at Totsukawa Onsen (a four-hour ride!).  Lots of inns to stay in.

Nishi-Yoshino Onsen: From JR Gojo take a bus to Jyodo (25 minutes).  Lots of inns.

Dorogawa Onsen and Ten no Kawa Onsen:  From Kintetsu Shimoichiguchi, take a bus to either Dorogawa-Onsen or Minami Hi-ura (for the latter) (about one and a half hours).  Inns available; can also use onsen for ¥510 and stay in a campsite.

Kenkomura — maybe not the actual Japanese name but many will understand what you mean.  We visited this facility one rainy, dreary holiday in January after having spent Christmas on the beaches of Thailand.  It is a large public bath. (baths as there are many to choose from- try the honeysuckle-smelling bath, the jacuzzis (only one person is meant to sit in these as I discovered after forcing one lady who was polite to say anything to leave) the sauna, the small pool (maybe for children only but then nobody expected the foreigner to know that.  There is even one bath that has an electric current running through it (We didn't see that one). 

Many Japanese come and spend the whole day for the low price of ¥2000.  If you want a massage or facial you pay  extra when you leave at the end of your visit. There are a number of restaurants inside. Again you pay as you leave.  It is the ultimate in relaxation and self-indulgence.  Inside you will see what resembles a hotel lobby with its woman roaming around in Hawaiian 'mumus' The men and boys wear more attractive shirts-and-shorts sets.   The baths and change areas are separate, of course. It's a great way to spend the day and experience public bathing.  You take the free bus from Yagi station.  Ask at the station and they will indicate where and how often the bus runs.  There are also bars in the adjacent high-rise entertainment blocks.  


Health lands (Kendo Rando)
==========================
Health lands are like bath-amusement parks, where the fee includes admission to indoor and outdoor hot springs, swimming pools, jacuzzi, and use of towel and bathrobe (food and massage cost extra).

Nara Kenko Rando: Free shuttle bus from JR/Kintetsu Tenri, Kintetsu Hirahata, or JR Koriyama.  ¥2300 adults, ¥1300 children; after 2 a.m. a mere ¥800!

Chojumura (health land): Catch a free shuttle bus from Kintetsu Yagi or Yamato-Takada.  Open 24 hours.  ¥2000 adults, ¥1000 children; after 2 a.m. 800.

While baths in private homes have dealt a blow to the neighborhood public baths, the latter can still be found in some areas and are worth seeking out.  Some offer special baths (such as the denki-buro, or electric bath).
