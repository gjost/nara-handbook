Buddhist temples
================

History
-------
Buddhism first entered Japan in 538 (or 552), when a Korean king sent Buddhist images to the Yamato clan head ("emperor") in Asuka.  For several hundred years afterwards,  anyone who was  anyone built a temple, producing an astoundingly high ratio of temples to people in Nara.   Many of them are historically significant, with art treasures and gardens and so on.

Names
-----
The names of Buddhist temples end in "-ji" (e.g. Todaiji), "-tera" (Hase-dera), or  "-in" (Monju-in).  

Etiquette
---------
Temple etiquette is the same as for most places of worship.  One should dress and act respectfully.  Loud voices are discouraged.  While most temples permit photography, be heedful of signs to the contrary;  also, Ask before taking pictures of priests or nuns.   In gates and doorways, it is considered both bad luck and rude to step ON the boundary (often a bar across the path).

Admission
---------
Admission to temples is generally around 300 yen, and this usually includes pamphlets in English and Japanese and entrance to the temple "treasure hall".

Souveneirs
----------
Many people collect mementos from temples they've visited, such as lucky charms (omamori), wooden prayer boards  (ema), or temple books, which are signed by a priest at the temple and stamped with the temple's seal.


Shinto shrines
==============

History
-------
Shrines are dedicated to Shinto gods or to Chinese gods such as Benten (goddess of music) and Ebisu (god of luck and prosperity).  In urban areas, many shrines are supported by merchants, and are dedicated to deities who prevent fires and disease.  These shrines often hold lively New Year's celebrations.  In the countryside, shrines are dedicated to agrarian gods and have a very active schedule of annual events: planting festivals (onda or otaue), festivals of welcoming the field-god to the field, ceremonies to ward off storms and pests or to call rain or wind, and harvest festivals, where the field-god is honored.  

Names
-----
Shrine names usually end in "-jinja" (e.g. Tatsuta Jinja) or "-jingu" (Kashihara-jingu).  Parent or main shrines (those with subsidiary shrines) are called "-taisha" (Tatsuta-taisha) or "-hongu" (Kumano Hongu).    

Etiquette
---------
In a shrine, sacred space is denoted by straw rope and white paper streamers.  One does not enter this space; nor does one enter the shrine proper, as it is the abode of the gods.  Prayers are made by ringing the bells, and then clapping, bowing, and clapping again.  The rules about photography are the same as for temples: shrine maidens (miko) in general prefer not to be photographed.

Admission
---------
Admission is not usually charged.  Pamphlets are usually available from the shrine office. 

Souvenirs
---------
Again, popular souvenirs are charms.  It is also possible (for a fee, of course!) to have blessings said for children (before a major exam, for example) or even cars.
