Do not rely on the accuracy of any of the information in this publication, and I cannot take responsibility for harm resulting from the use of this publication!  As I write this (November 2008), the Nara Handbook is thirteen years old.  Except in places where I have linked to something and the link resolves, you should assume that every single phone number and address has changed, and that every business or cultural establishment has gone out of business or otherwise ceased to exist.
