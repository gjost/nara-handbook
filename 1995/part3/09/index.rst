IX. Northern Nara
#################

There were some complaints last year from Nara-ken JETs that the Handbook was heavily biased towards Nara City.  We did as much as we could this year to include more information about other parts of Nara Prefecture, and now it may seem that there is a disproportionate amount of information about Southern Nara; however, much of the material included about Southern Nara is not available in English, and had to be translated specially for this book.  Anyhoo, hope you enjoy it!
