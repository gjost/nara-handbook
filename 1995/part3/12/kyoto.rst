Kyoto

Introduction
============

It’s the rarest of rare places in Japan:  In the face of modernity, Kyoto somehow retains its uniquely Japanese charm and beauty.  Volumes have been written on this subject, but for starters, it’s best to buy a good guide book.  The *Lonely Planet* is good, but the encyclapedic *Japan Inside Out* is even better.  Also, get the excellent *Must See In Kyoto* guide—an illustrated little blue book by JTB; it can be picked up in any English bookstore (it's in the same series as other classics such as *A Look Into Japan*, *Living Japanese Style* and *A Look Into Tokyo*).

How to Get There
----------------
Both the Kintetsu and JR Nara lines take you to the central Kyoto station.  Just outside the main entrance is the bus station.  Here you can take buses to all areas of Kyoto.  

Getting Around
--------------
Buses are cheap (about ¥200) but can take awhile getting anywhere, particularly during rush-hours and during major festivals.  Ask any of the bus inspectors which number bus you need to take you to your destination.  Alternatively, the TICs will probably be able to furnish you with a decent map.  

You can get free maps and tourist information from one of the tourist offices just north of the station.  The Tourist Information Center (075-371-0480) in the Kyoto Tower Hotel, is open from 9 am - 5 pm on weekdays and 9 am - 12 pm  on Saturday.  The City Information Office (075-343-6655) by the bus terminal is open every day from 9 am to 5 pm. 

Also, “Kyoto Visitor’s Guide,” a monthly source of useful festival and special event schedules, along with excellent maps, has recently resumed publication.  Available free of charge at TIC and other major tourist spots.  

Aside from buses, trains are a quick way of getting around Kyoto.  See directions later in this section. 

Sightseeing:  The Essentials
============================

Unlike Nara, which is relatively compact and easy to explore on foot, Kyoto is spread out and requires the use of buses and trains.   Don't try and see too much in one go or you'll wear yourself out.  Kyoto is always there so discover it at your leisure.

East Kyoto (Higashiyama)
------------------------
Ginkakuji temple; Kiyomizu-dera; Sanjusangen-do temple; and the Path of Philosophy (particularly in the cherry blossom season).  For a slice of old Japan, a visit to the Gion district is recommended; you may even be lucky enough to see the odd geisha or maiko (apprentice geisha) strolling around.

North-West Kyoto (Kitayama)
---------------------------
Kinkakuji Temple—One of Japan’s best known sights; and Ryoanji, with its famous sand and rock garden.

West Kyoto (Arashiyama)
-----------------------
Togetsu-kyo Bridge, Tenryu-ji temple. 

Arashiyama is a beautiful area in western Kyoto where a row on the river is highly recommended (if you're feeling argumentative).  From Shijo Station (see above) take the Hankyu Kyoto line as far as Arashima.  Alternatively, from Kyoto Station, take the San-in Line as far as Saga station and walk a little ways to Tongetsu Bridge.  Also look for the temple mentioned above. 

Central Kyoto (Rakuchu)
-----------------------
Nijo-jo (Nijo Castle)—Though doesn’t really rival Himeji-jo in Hyogo-ken, it’s worth seeing (and hearing the Nightingale Floors).  

Entertainment
=============

Festivals and cultural events
-----------------------------

There are numerous festivals to see in Kyoto, and the little blue book *Must See In Kyoto* covers many of them.  The most popular are the following:  

Aoi Matsuri — Every May 15th; possibly Japan’s oldest festival.  

Gion Matsuri — July 16th and 17th; one of Japan’s best known festivals.

Miyako Odori — Every day during April.  This indoor event features Maiko dancing to traditional music.  A wonderful experience, particularly if you’re with visiting relatives.  In the theater “Kobu-Kaburenjo,” next to Gion Corner.  Tickets from ¥1,650 to ¥3,800 (the latter includes a mini-tea ceremony).  


Other Events And Things To Do
-----------------------------

Gion Corner has shows each evening at 7:40 and 8:40 between March 1 and November 29.  Sure, it’s for tourists, but you’ll see a little of the tea ceremony, koto, ikebana, kyogen, dancing, and bunraku (puppets).  A good sampler for those Japan-weary or wary visiting relatives.  ¥2,500.

Kyoto Connection is a free performance evening and “gathering” held on the 3rd Saturday of every month (except August and December).  To get there, take bus 46 from Shijo station and get off at Ushiwaka.  It’s in the Teatro Marron, above the Farrago Rome restaurant.  For more details, call Ken Rogers at 075-712-7129.

Flea Markets
------------
There are two big monthly markets in Kyoto: On the 21st in Toji Temple (Toji station on the Kintetsu line to Kyoto).  On the 25th at Kitano Tenman-Gu shrine.  Lots of junk, interesting prints and antiques, piles of yukata and kimono (as low as ¥1,000), and a few funky fellow bargain hunters now and then.  It’s fun just to rummage through the stuff and people-watch.  

Temple Lodgings
---------------
Known as “shokubo” in Japanese, temple lodgings typically offer simple digs, optional morning prayers, early curfew, and nearby public baths.  Usually from ¥3,000.  Also, lodgings for women-only are offered at Rokuo-in, in western Kyoto (tel. 861-1645).  Kyoto TIC has full shokubo info.  

Shijo And Kawaramachi Area
--------------------------
This is the main shopping and nightlife area.  (Please see accompanying map.)  You can get there by buses 4, 5 and 205 from Kyoto Station.  If you want to go there directly from Nara, it’s quicker to change from Kintetsu before Kyoto Station, at Tambabashi.  From there, change to Keihan line, and it’s three stops by express to Keihan Shijo Station.  


Kyoto Shopping
==============

In Shijo-Kawaramachi area, you’ll find three department stores, two large covered arcades, the famed Gion, the Kyoto Handicraft Center, the riverside entertainment district, Meijiya imported food store, Virgin records, and Maruzen bookstore.  And much more!  You may wish to travel there directly by train rather than by bus.  On the Kyoto-bound Kintetsu train from Nara, alight at Tambabashi and change onto the Keihan Line.  Take this train as far as Shijo, right near Kawaramachi-Dori.  This will also bring you within striking distance of Gion and Higashiyama.

**Maruzen** — Arguably better than Kinokuniya in Osaka in that it has a bigger selection of English books (an entire floor) and a huge fiction section.  Its new, spacious building is a much more pleasant place to browse than the cramped aisles of Kinokuniya.  Located on Kawaramachi between Shijo-dori and Sanjo-dori.

**Kyoto Handicraft Center** — Near Heian Shrine (Heian-jingu).  Loads of traditional goods such as yukata, scrolls and prints.  Nearby (check a map) is Shinmonzen Street, the center of the local antique trade, with wares from every corner of Asia.  It’s a great place to shop, but not a place to buy!
