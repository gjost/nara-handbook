A word on Internationalization
##############################


Our good friend Mike Davies was recently in an intellectual vein of mind (heâ€™s since recovered) and penned these words specially for the distinguished readers of the JETset Nara (and reprinted for the Handbook).  We thought he managed to effectively distill (no pun intended) the vague concept of internationalization for our readers.

    One important aspect of our work here as JETs is that of promoting "internationalization."  This rather vague concept has been discussed at great length in books and journals but has so far failed to result in a satisfactory workable definition.
    
    It would seem therefore that it is up to us, as individuals, to impart internationalization in whichever way we see fit.  Some may encourage internationalization by public speaking, others by attending local events, others still by simply existing in their communities.
    
    I personally, have thought about internationalization very seriously and I have arrived at a very effective method by which to implement it.
    
    Once, or maybe even twice a week, I can be observed on active duty, sitting in my local Akachochin (Red Lantern) bar internationalizing at great length.  Some cynics may regard this as simply an excuse to overindulge in alcohol.  I would refute this arguing, that it is a major contribution to internationalization at the grass-roots level.
    
    In my local bar I internationalize late into the night and sometimes into the small hours of the morning.  Occasionally, I internationalize so hard that I have difficulty walking - in one incident I even fell down a ditch on the way home after a particularly heavy bout of internationalizing.  As I limped home I reasoned that such accidents were inevitably going to happen when two such diverse cultures collided.  But my sore back and multiple bruises did not discourage me - oh, no - with evangelical resolve, I purposefully headed back to the bar to recommence my internationalizing.
    
    When I reported the incident to the locals, they laughed understandingly and it was then that I realized just how much they appreciated my efforts.  For in my own humble way, I had shone the bright light of internationalization into the gloomy interior of their bar.
    
    What a martyr I am.
