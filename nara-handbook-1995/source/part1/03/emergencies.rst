In a medical emergency
	Call 119 (the fire department) to summon an ambulance (kyukyu-sha). 
 	Give your NAME, ADDRESS (or PRESENT LOCATION), and PHONE 	
		NUMBER.  
	Many hospitals are not open at night, so it is better to take an ambulance
	(they know where to go).

FYI, the following hospitals are open nights and holidays (although exact schedules vary, call for more information) (* includes dental emergencies):
