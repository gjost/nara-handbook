Privacy, Personal Safety, and Sexual Harassment
###############################################


Nara is a rural prefecture and it is not easy to become lost in the crowd.  The good side of this is that you are always a celebrity and neighbors know your friends and daily routine.  This is also the bad side!

JETs of Asian descent face different problems, among them being: people mistaking you for Japanese, people discussing white JETs in less-than-p.c. terms, and being unable to relate to some of the experiences of fellow JETs--and therefore feeling isolated.   

Considering the close proximity in which the Japanese have lived for centuries, you may be surprised at how noisy your apartment building is.  In most cases, as with crying babies and howling stray cats, you just learn to block it out as the Japanese do.  However, if you have a persistent noise problem such as late-night arguments or loud music, do not hesitate to contact your landlord.  Your apartment is your private place to escape and you must be able to relax there.

Never forget that you are being watched...always.  Neighbors know when and with whom you come and go, so you may want to use some discretion with overnight visitors.  They are also watching your laundry, so hide any intimates that you don’t want inspected or stolen.  Also, in the hot summer you will want your windows and curtains open.  It’s like being in a fish bowl, so act accordingly and beware of peeping toms.

The best policy might be to keep your curtains closed at night or at least invest in some bamboo shades (sudare--can be found at home stores).  Be aware, however, that bamboo shades are NOT opaque at night!  Another option is a kind of roll-up shoji, which is opaque.  You can get them at Dai-Chu in Nara (see the Kinki Shopping section).

Familiarize yourself with the nearest police box, fire station and hospital and memorize emergency telephone numbers, including a taxi service.  There is a page in the back of this book which has this info—photocopy it and put it up near your phone. 

It may also be prudent to get to know some of those nosy neighbors, especially a family, so if you do have trouble there is somebody nearby that you can trust.  In Japan it is common to knock and then enter another’s home.  The entrance hall is not considered part of the private home so it is strongly advised to keep your door locked.  Some JETs are uncomfortable with ground-floor apartments.  If this is your case, ask to move before you freak yourself out or worse. 

You will be told that Japan is a safe country; however, here in Nara there have been incidents of sexual harassment, peeping toms, panty thieves, followings, and actual assaults.  Remember to take the same precautions that you would in your home country.  

 - Lock doors and windows, especially at night.
 - Dry underwear indoors; try not to leave laundry unattended.
 - Don't walk at night through unlit areas.
 - Don't accept rides home from strangers or new acquaintances.
 - Don't give out your phone number or address; don't let your office, either!
 - After parties or enkais, be careful about who takes you home.
 - Carry the number of a local taxi service (or of a friend with a car).


Should an incident occur:
-------------------------

 - Tell the person their attentions are offensive
 - Move away or ask for help
 - Run, scream, and draw attention to yourself
 - Grab an offending hand and yell "Chikan!" (pervert)

Speaking Out:
=============

Sexual harassment is gradually being taken more seriously in Japan; however, there are still those who treat it as a joke or who blame the victim.  Many Japanese women (and men) keep silent out of shame and fear of repercussions.

Do speak to your supervisor or a colleague about the problem--request specifically that you want the conversation to be confidential.  Discuss what actions can be taken.  Should the issue not be taken seriously, talk to someone else.  CIRs, Prefectural Advisors, and CLAIR are there for you.
Silence is golden--for the offender.

Should a serious incident occur:
================================

 - Call a close friend and someone who can translate.
 - Go to the hospital-DO NOT shower or clean up.
 - Let your supervisor, Kokusaika, and the police know as necessary.
 - Don't blame yourself!
