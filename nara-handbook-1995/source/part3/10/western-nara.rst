Western Nara
############


Western Nara's most prominent feature is that it's mostly flat, so it is often referred to as the Yamato Plain.  It is the area most affected by Osaka's crawl over the mountains—bedroom communities have developed around the major transport hubs of Oji, Yagi and Takada and near the freeways.  Not terribly much good hiking here, but it's easy to get around on a bike and easy to get around if you're near a train station.


Oji-cho
=======

Oji has an incredible fireworks display every August!  It goes on for at least an hour, and people turn out for the festival atmosphere as much as for the fireworks.  The area on the south side of the station has all the modern stuff you need:  supermarkets, restaurants, a video shop and Mr.Donuts, while the north side has character:  many nice old buildings and neighborhoods.  Walk out to the river and back.


Kawai-cho
=========

A schizophrenic little town caught between spreading suburbia and traditional ways of life.  On the north sides of Owada and Ikebe stations, there are nice neighborhoods in the old style of architecture, and no tourists.  Not outstanding, perhaps, but relaxing.  There is an interesting “Sand-throwing Festival” (Suna-kake Matsuri) every February:  There's a day-long ceremonial reenactment of the rice planting/harvesting cycle, acted out by a farmer and a cow (played by the guy at the local Hitachi shop), and interrupted by short periods of sand-pitching chaos.  You will not have seen anything like it at any other festival!  It’s great fun and you’ll remember the festival for weeks afterward as you dig sand from your pockets.


Taima-cho
=========

For a small town that doesn’t appear on most maps, Taima-cho holds an impressive collection of attractions, not the least remarkable being the comprehensive sewage system.  Principle among them is Taima-dera, the only temple in Japan with twin original Hakuho Period pagoda, which is famed for its peonies, and a festival in May, when 15 of Taima-cho’s finest, heavily disguised as Boddhisattva, escort a statue of saintly Princess Chujo to heaven.  This “home town” festival has been recommended by local JETs.  

Here’s a little-known fact:  Taima-cho is also where Sumo began, with a terminal kick in the ribs from Taima-cho’s champion.  His monument stands outside the Sumo Museum, which is halfway along the road between the temple and the station.  It contains pictures, equipment and memorabilia, plus a full-sized sumo ring (no English info, though).  Taima-dera Station is on Kintetsu’s Kashihara-Abenobashi line (locals only), about 15 minutes from Kashihara-jingumae.


Tawaramoto
==========

Tawaramoto is host to a Kintetsu line express stop, and also the Nara Wellness Center (Nara Kenkoh-zukuri-Center), which has a small gym with very affordable prices.  The area around Tawaramoto station features many old streets and is pleasant to walk around.

Yamato-Takada
=============

You may be relieved to hear that Takada is not abundant in shrines, temples or museums or anything particularly cultural.  What does Takada have, then?  Well, shops, basically: Saty (near Kintetsu Takada-shi station) and Daiei (near Kintetsu Yamato-Takada or JR Takada station).  There are also 2 cinemas, one near Yamato-Takada station or JR station, the other near Saty.  There is a new swimming pool which is cheap but a little out of town, near Shinjo, and an older pool situated behind Daiei.

Takada Cinemas
--------------

**Takada Daigeki** - Tel: 0745-52-3035.  From Kintetsu Takada-shi station, go straight, past Lotteria, past Saty until the road splits into 3.  Cross over to NTT.  With NTT on your right, walk along the road, then take the first street on your right.  The cinema is down this street, on the left.

**Takada Cinema** - Tel: 0745-52-2769.  From Kintetsu Yamato-Takada station, turn right and go up the slope, through the arcade.  Turn left at the top.  Continue through the arcade, over the railway, and the cinema is on the right.


Kashihara City
==============

For many JETs, Kashihara-jingumae is a major station.  Gateway to the South or escape hatch to the North for the forlorn few stranded “Below the Line” (Minami Osaka).  Trains run north to Yagi, Saidaiji, Kyoto; south to Yoshino; and west to Osaka’s Abenobashi.    But Kashihara is more than just a transportation hub: visiting the Kashihara Archaeology Museum might help you make sense of the ancient relics around Nara-ken (no English info, though).  Interesting if you’re interested, the museum is within walking distance of both Kashihara-jingumae and Unebigoryomae stations.

In the unlikely event that you must wait at Kashiharajingumae station between trains, there’s always the jingu (shrine) that the station is mae (in front of).  Set in attractive parkland, visited by royalty, Kashihara-jingu has a distinguished history of close ties with the Imperial Family.  It’s about two minutes’ walk from the station.


Yagi
====

Yes, all roads really do lead to Yagi, the most famous part of Kashihara City.  In fact, with the exception of a movie theater, almost anything can be found.  While the most enjoyable way to do Yagi is to just show up and explore, here are a few suggestions.  Disclaimer:  This is an abstract map and if you try to take it too literally, you will see just how abstract it is!  All locations were here when the map was prepared (April 1993), but who knows?  In addition, always remember that this is Japan (like you're going to forget) and everything closes early..with one bright shining exception:  Cafe Anjou, #8, open 'til 11:59.  So you don't have to worry about missing that last train out!

Asuka
=====

Asuka is the first known capital of Japan, predating even Nara.  There are two small historical museums, one (¥400) exhibiting excavated 7th-century murals from an emperor’s tomb, the other (no charge) offering more general local information, including a video in English.  The “sights” are really more “sites,” and they extend over a large area; most are simple burial mounds and ancient stone formations.  Bikes can be rented from either Kashihara-jingumae or Asuka stations.  The latter has the advantage of an information center, which can supply maps, pamphlets, and postcards.  But be forewarned:  Asuka does get terribly crowded with “rental-cyclists” from time to time.  Asuka is on Kintetsu’s Yoshino line (change at Kashihara).
