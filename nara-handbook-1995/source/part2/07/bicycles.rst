Now when I say bike I mean a real bike, not your typical Japanese clunker (called a mama-chari in Japanese).  Nara Prefecture offers the bicycle enthusiast ample opportunities to get  out on the road.  Mountain bikers are especially lucky as most of Nara is covered with mountains, which are in turn covered with trails.  Speak to the country JETs about local hiking trails.


Buying a Bike in Japan
======================

Here are some local bike shops.  Careful not to get sticker shock!

- **Dinosaur.** behind NaraFamily in Saidaiji.  Carries a wide range of frames and accessories at very high prices.
- **Mike Schultz - Kobe.** Mike comes recommended by various JETs.  He carries TREK bikes and various accessories.  Mike has no showroom.  Instead he offers his customers other stores' showroom models or those with nicks or scratches, which your typical Japanese consumer wouldn't want.  Give him a call to see what's available at  0726-41-6213, fax:  0726-41-6213.
- **Free bicycles** can be easily obtained, either on big garbage day (see Garbage), from JR stations (just ask the conductors if there are any old bikes lying around you may take), or certain dumping and recycling facilities.  Mary Lyons, a former JET, has a weird friend named Ichiro who works in a place which collects old bikes--he can get you an old but sturdy bike easily.  Ask other AETs if you wish to get in touch with Mary and Ichiro.  Also, ask around about the Silver Center in Takada--they do bike repairs and may have old bikes for you.


Transporting your bike
======================

If you transport your bike by train, you will need a bike bag and you may need an additional ticket.  I've heard that Mike Schultz (see below) carries such bags.  You can take your bike on the train, as long as it’s partially collapsible (i.e.. take the front wheel off) and it’s in some kind of bag.  Buy a ¥290 luggage ticket for your bike in addition to your ticket.  Mike Schultz makes a quick-and-dirty bike bag thingy for ¥3-4000 that fits in a water bottle holder.
 

Accessories
===========

Besides the aforementioned Mike Schultz, any local bike shop should have catalogues of accessories such as slick tires, bike lights, etc.  Also, many home centers carry the same items.  Local bike shops can also handle basic repairs.  If you want accessories like those found in most foreign bikes shops, give this number a call for a catalogue:  ( 001-1-800-727-2453).


Other Options
=============

Should you go abroad on vacation, you can always bring a bike back with you.  Most airlines will transport your bike as check-on luggage if you remove the pedals.  They should even supply the box for you.  Give them a call before you bring your bike to the airport.

As for repairs you can always bring your bike into the local shop, but fixing it yourself will ultimately save you money (unless you really screw it up) and teach you a lot about bikes in the meantime.  In general, leave any bearings alone, but with a simple tool kit available from L.L. Bean or the aforementioned accessory catalogue people, you should be OK.  L.L. Bean also sells a bike maintenance and repair video for about  $20.00 US.  L.L. Bean can be contacted at 001-1-207-865-3111 or 3161.
