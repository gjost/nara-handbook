Getting your bearings
#####################


If the Kinki Area Rail System map was a bit confusing, here’s a more practical map to help you get started:


Most subway exits and many train stations have a compass set into the ground showing where north is.  All subway stations and many train stations have maps of the immediate area.  If you can’t find them ask the man at the ticket gate, or inquire at a police box.


Map books
=========

It really helps to have a good map book.  One of the best is Kyoto-Osaka: A Bilingual Atlas (Kodansha, ¥2200), which has maps of Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe, a detailed (some say rather confusing) train map, and indexes to help you find all the places on the maps.  Shobunsha (the publishing company) has some map books which are really detailed, bilingual, and photocopy well.  They may have an edition for Kansai by now.  If you’ve got a working knowledge of kanji, or just want to look like it, get the Pia Map Bunko.  This is a really handy little book which has everything: detailed train, expressway and area maps, lists of last trains, transit times from different points, and fare tables.  There is also an interesting book entitled The Book of Kansai.

Schedules
=========
You can get station schedules for (jikanhyo - they tell which trains leave from which tracks and when) from station masters at all but the smallest stations.  Note the different weekday (heijitsu) and Sunday/holiday (nichi-shukujitsu) schedules.  Schools and offices often have train schedule books (jikokuhyo) which look like phone books.  There is a train schedule sample page and a how-to section in the JET memo.  Time tables and fares often change in September and March...beware.

General Train Info
==================
Trains are generally punctual to the minute (you can set your watch by them, in fact) and generally safe.  The really cool thing, if you come from a car society like California’s, is that you can doze, zone out and even sleep while you ride! (sleeping does take a bit of practice, though).  A few caveats: Women should be careful riding the trains alone at night.  Drunk and obnoxious men are usually returning home and can cause trouble.


Money-Saving Tips
=================

Bulk-rate
---------
If you travel along the same route often, ask about kaisuuken.  These are books of 11 tickets for the price of ten (for the same distance), the eleventh fare being free.

Tochuu
------
Tochuu  means "on the way."  Basically, the Kintetsu lines let you leave the stations along the way between two points if there is a Kintetsu department store at the station (i.e. Yagi, Saidaiji, Fuse, Uehommachi).  For example, you live in Tawaramoto and want to go to Saidaiji (big Kintetsu store there).  You buy a regular ticket from Tawaramoto to Nara and get off anyway at Saidaiji.  Say "tochu" to the station attendant and he’ll let you through (or just go through the automatic gate).  When you come back to the station, say, "tochu" again and he’ll let you back in (or again just go through the automatic gate).

Train cards
-----------
Convenient because you don't have to be fumbling for change all the time: can keep one in your wallet and one somewhere else for emergencies.  By using cards you can more easily keep track of how much money you’re spending on the trains.  And you usually get a little more than you pay for (i.e. ¥1100 card for ¥1000).  They are called either "Orange Card" (JR) or "Pearl Card" (Kintetsu).  You can also get a "Pearl Card 11" , which is like a "11 for the price of 10" kaisuuken—for a specified distance.


Cheap Thrills
=============
If you’re really bored, or really short on cash, here’s a way to pass the time and go all over Nara:  Just buy the cheapest ticket and ride.  As long as you don’t go out of the stations, you can come back to where you started and not have to pay anything extra.  Admittedly, it wouldn’t be too interesting to ride around downtown Osaka, but the views on parts of the Yoshino line are nice, and it passes the time.
