Earthquakes
===========


Be Prepared!
------------
- Keep a rucksack by the door with emergency supplies:
  food and water for 2-3 days (Calorie Mate!)
  originals/copies of ALL IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS
  lists of phone numbers
  changes of clothes, underwear
  1st aid kit, tape, knife, toilet paper
  bowl and eating utensils
  flashlight, radio, whiskey (sterilizes & makes friends!)
  (one method involves wrapping supplies in spare t-shirts, then in  layers of trash bags: dry, practical, and useful!)
- Attach heavy furniture to walls, floor, ceiling with brackets
- Know where your place of evacuation is

Don't Panic!
------------
- DON'T rush outside; get under a sturdy table until quake stops
- Open a door to secure an escape route
- If outside, get into a clear area away from falling roof tiles, signs, walls
- Turn off all gas appliances
- Protect your head with cushions or pillows
- Don't use candles or open flames if you smell gas or suspect that there's a leak
- Fill your bathtub in case water is shut off


Typhoons
========

Nara  does not suffer from the same damage that coastal areas have, but typhoons bring strong winds and torrential rain.  To prepare, bring inside items that can be blown down or knocked over (bicycles, etc.)  Those JETs who drive should pay attention to traffic alerts, as landslides are not unknown, particularly in the mountains.

Information and Communication
=============================

- Listen to the radio or TV for correct information
- If necessary, move to evacuation center; LEAVE A NOTICE OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS TAPED TO YOUR DOOR!
- CALL your embassy/consulate, workplace, and family  (Phone lines in this year's quake worked if you called out, but not in, so call people to let them know you're OK. )
