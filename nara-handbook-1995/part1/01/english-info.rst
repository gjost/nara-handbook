Information Centers
===================

Well, we wanted to write a section about good info sources but we ran out of time!  Your best bet is to call NIFS at 0742-27-1822 and ask the resident CIR where to go (he or she will surely tell you where to go).  Several libraries contain English books, used book stores are listed in the City Source Guide and are much cheaper than the major bookstores, and info about newspapers, magazines, and other publications and their availability can be obtained at NIFS.  Travel info is listed in a section of this book, and jump around to other sections for more numbers to call.  Sorry there's no more than this, guys--something to work on for next year.

A major source of info is, as you've heard by now, the Kansai Time Out monthly—this handbook owes a heavy debt to KTO for much useful stuff.  There are also several English-language newspapers which you might subscribe to.  Foreign magazine subscriptions are not cheap, but there is a company which offers discounts on subscriptions.  They usually have information handouts at JET conferences.
