Sensitive Issues and suggested reading
######################################

Some subjects which are discussed freely in Western cultures are not discussed as freely in Japan, for various reasons.  Mentioning these issues without ample understanding may cause friction with friends or associates which you might not perceive and about which you might never be informed.   

This section is not intended to make a political statement; each of us has his/her own opinions concerning these issues and must make decisions about when and where to discuss them.  Nor is the list a complete one.  The idea is that knowing about a few of these issues will help us deal with them, and with similar subjects, appropriately.  We were selected for the JET Program in part because we displayed sensitivity in dealing with persons from other countries, but it is helpful to know what it is we should be sensitive about.  

The sections below are taken from Japan:  An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Copyright 1993, Kodansha Ltd., Tokyo).  Consult that book or ask trusted veteran AET friends for more information. 

The National Anthem--The de facto Japanese national anthem (kokka) is "Kimigayo" (His Majesty's Reign).  The following is a translation: ::

    Kimi ga yo wa
    Chiyo ni yachiyo ni
    Sazare ishi no
    Iwao to nari te
    Koke no musu made
    
    Thousands of years of happy reign be thine;
    Rule on, my lord, till what are pebbles now
    By age united to mighty rocks shall grow
    Whose venerable sides the moss doth line.

The anthem is sung at state ceremonies and sports events.  According to the Course of Study, published by Monbusho, the National Anthem is to be sung on ceremonial days.  It is controversial because of its references to the emperor.

The Emperor--(tenno, "heavenly sovereign") A small but vocal minority of Japanese believe that the emperor, by his very nature as a hereditary monarch, contradicts democracy, while others believe that a resurgence of Japanese fascism or absolutism is possible so long as the imperial institution is permitted to exist.  But the vast majority of Japanese citizens favor the status quo.  This was confirmed when, in January 1989, Emperor Akihito became the first emperor to succeed to the throne under the present constitution.  The death of his father, Emperor Showa (known as Hirohito during his lifetime--after death an emperor is referred to in terms of the period of his reign), and the ceremonies surrounding Akihito's enthronement sparked a renewed examination of Japan's imperial system and its legacy, but at the time of his accession Emperor Akihito, in a statement that was very well received by the Japanese public, explicitly affirmed his commitment to the symbolic role assigned to him by the constitution.  Despite dissenting voices, it seems clear that the consensus in Japan continues to support the retention of the imperial house, within a carefully defined legal framework, as a visible manifestation of Japan's links with its past and an assurance of continuity for its future.

The National Flag--(kokki)  The national flag of Japan has a crimson disc, symbolizing the sun, in the center of a white field.  It is popularly known as the Himomaru (literally, "sun disc").  The "rising sun" flag with 16 rays used by the former Japanese navy and by the present Maritime Self Defense Forces is a military service flag and should not be confused with the national flag.  However, the Socialist Party now accepts the flag; only the Communist Party rejects it.

The National Cheer--(banzai, literally "ten thousand years") The word banzai, which is of Chinese origin, was in use in Japan from around the 8th century in the sense of "long life" to express respect for the emperor.  It is the Japanese equivalent of the English "three cheers."  Used at celebratory parties and welcoming or farewell banquets to express common congratulations, encouragement, or exhortation.  The participants shout the word banzai three times in unison, raising their hands in the air each time.  Again, it is controversial because of its invocation to the emperor; it was used during World War II when rallying troops to respect the emperor.  The association with the war is diminishing or unrecognized by most people today; it is also unlikely that the majority of people knew of the term prior to the Meiji Era.
	
World War II--(Dainiji Sekai Taisen) Obviously too much to comment on here.  This is the most sensitive issue for many older Japanese.  It is worth pointing out that the Japanese generally think of the war as beginning on 8 December 1941 with the invasion of Pearl Harbor.  This is because the Japanese government did not legally proclaim war until that year.  The invasion of Manchuria in 1931 is referred to as the Manshu Jihen, or Manchurian Incident.  The war in China which began in 1937 is referred to as the Nitchu Senso, or Sino-Japanese War of 1937-45.

The Great Hanshin Earthquake--(Hanshin Daishin) The name used to refer to the earthquake and aftershocks that occurred beginning January 17, 1995 in the Kobe area.  Many people in Nara Prefecture have friends or relatives in Kobe and many students have been transferred to Nara Prefecture since the quake.  Many people would not at all be bothered and might even appreciate your interest in the disaster.  However, a person who has lost family members, friends, or property because of the quake might feel awkward discussing the matter.

Bullying--(ijime) Bullying among schoolchildren became a serious social problem in Japan in the 1970s and continues to be a problem today.  In a survey conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education, bullying is defined as "behavior directed against someone weaker than oneself; objectionable behavior in which physical or psychological attacks are carried out repeatedly, causing deep suffering to the victim."  Since 1986 the incidence of bullying has decreased, but the problem has shifted from physical violence to verbal abuse and the practice of ostracizing unpopular students.

School Allergy--(toko kyohi) Condition, increasingly prevalent among Japanese schoolchildren, in which the child is unable to attend school for emotional reasons.  As the time for school approaches, the child develops headaches, fever, or nausea and becomes unable to leave home.  It has been suggested that school allergy develops in response to the intensification of such problems as bullying among students, competitive school entrance examinations, and the administrative rigidity of the school atmosphere.  According to a Ministry of Education survey, the number of middle-school pupils who had missed 30 or more days of school for emotional reasons in 1974 was 7,310.  In 1991 the number had increased to 54,112.  The corresponding numbers for elementary school students were 2,651 in 1974 and 12,637 in 1991.

The Japanese Mafia--Usually referred to as yakuza (literally "8,9,3" but with the implication of "gangster, gambler, good-for-nothing"), the Japanese mafia have traditionally operated on the system of social or economic support known as oyabun-kobun ("parent role-child role").  Like their criminal counterparts around the world, Japanese gangsters attempt to dignify their cruel trade with elaborate codes of honor and behavior.  In Japan these codes are a pastiche of the Neo-Confucian-based Tokugawa ethics and the samurai or warrior code.  

The word yakuza is taken from a gambling game called "three card" (sammai karuta), which became popular during the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1867).  Yakuza is a losing hand in the game, which resembles blackjack or 21 in that the goal is to reach but not exceed 19.  Gangsters adopted this apparently derogatory term with the bravado of the outsider who scorns conventional society and its ideas of success.  According to a National Police Agency survey made in 1990, there are 88,259 members of 3,305 gangs in Japan.  

Meeting yakuza or talking about them can be a little risky.  Using terms like "gangsters" and "organized crime" will avoid having your conversation sound like the following to Japanese:

    I blah blah blah blah yakuza blah blah blah mafia blah blah yakuza blah yakuza blah last night blah blah blah Japan, blah blah yakuza...

Yakuza are powerful in parts of Nara, Osaka, Kobe, Tokyo, and other areas.  Some bath houses are notorious hangouts for yakuza.  Members of the yakuza often have ornate tattoos but not always; at any rate the tattoos are a good warning sign, so watch out for them.  Ask other AETs for more information and about areas to avoid.
