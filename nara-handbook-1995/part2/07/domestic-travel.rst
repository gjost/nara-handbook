Travel Information
==================

Probably the first place you should check is a travel guide (we don’t really need to tell you this, do we?).  You probably brought one with you when you came.  If not, check any of the big bookstores.  Last year, there were special deals with Foreign Buyers’ Club for JETs.  Lonely Planet’s is pretty much the standard, but each guide has its adherents, some of whom religiously defend the merits of their respective sacred texts.  

AJET has a series of travel guides, written and produced by JETs, for JETs, from a JET perspective.  Contact the AJET representative (you’ll know who this is) for info on these guides.

There is a travel section one day each week in the English newspapers.  You can get up-to-date information on  hotels,  airlines,  day/weekend  trips, festivals, etc.

There are various books on camping, cycling and onsens in Japan written in English.  These can be bought at Kinokuniya, Maruzen or Asahiya bookstores.

Don’t forget to ask around and find out where other JETs have been to or where they’re planning to go to.  There are many more wild stories than are printed here.  Keep your ears open and ask lots of questions!


Traveling on the cheap
======================

Staying
-------
Youth Hostels usually offer the cheapest accommodation.  Many guide books have lists of Youth Hostels.  The Lonely Planet guide book lists hostels according to geographical area.  You can also read a book from JNTO office called “Welcome Inns” in Japan.  This lists Youth Hostels and other affordable accommodation.  You may also like to have someone send you a Youth Hostel guide book in English from your home country.

**Tatami Timeshare** AJET members have access to this system in which you are able to stay at a fellow JET’s place for free.

**Ryokan** Traditional Japanese style inn that features tatami rooms, ofuro (Japanese bath), Japanese food, yukata, slippers and geta.  Refer to Welcome Inns book and other guide books.  Ryokan range in price from ¥3500 to ¥20,000+.
